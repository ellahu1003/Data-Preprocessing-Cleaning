Data Cleaning: 
This file involves cleaning the dataset store_income_data_task using the libraries pandas and fuzzywuzzy. 
It demonstrates tasks including: loading the dataset, standardising and cleaning the "country" column to ensure uniformity, 
and parsing the "date_measured" column to create a new "days_ago" column that reflects the number of days from the current date.
The data used for Data Cleaning is the store_income_data_task.csv file.

Data Preprocessing:
This file involves preprocessing data through handling missing data,
deciding the scaling method and scaling the data, and visualising the data using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
The data used for Data Preprocessing is also the store_income_data_task.csv file.
